# Motivation

On my personal website, I would like to showcase some photos of me with different research groups to highlight my research experience and collaborations.

## 1. Professor Ding Hongwei's Research Group (September 2019 - June 2022)

From September 2019 to June 2022, I pursued a master's degree in Communication and Information Systems at the School of Information, Yunnan University, under the supervision of Professor Ding Hongwei. During this period, my main research focus was on object detection technology. Through participation in various projects, I gained extensive experience and made significant contributions to the field.

## 1.1 Our Funding

* **National Natural Science Foundation Project** : Research on Fusion-Based Multiple Access Communication Network Theory and Control Protocols (Project No.: 61461053, Funding: 400,000 RMB)

* Research on Key Technologies in Communication and Applications of Artificial Intelligence
* Yunnan Ding Hongwei Grassroots Expert Workstation

## 2. Professor Li Haiyan's Research Group (September 2022 - December 2025)

Since September 2022, I have been pursuing a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering at the School of Information, Yunnan University, under the supervision of Professor Li Haiyan. My research has gradually focused on multimodal detection and remote sensing forest fire detection. Given the frequent forest fires in Yunnan, my research aims to improve the accuracy and speed of forest fire detection using advanced computer vision and multimodal detection techniques, effectively preventing the spread of forest fires and protecting ecological environments and human lives.

## 2.1 Our Funding

* **National Natural Science Foundation Project** : Study on Multimodal Target Monitoring and Tracking Technology Based on Visual Perception and Semantic Cognition at the Yunnan Border, with project numbers 62266049 and 62066047, and a funding amount of 400,000 RMB.
