## Research Interests

* Computer Vision
* Multimodal Object Detection
* Remote Sensing Forest Fire Detection

Since my master's studies, I have been dedicated to research in object detection. Given the frequent forest fires in Yunnan in recent years, my research has gradually focused on remote sensing forest fire detection.

My research aims to develop advanced computer vision and multimodal detection techniques to improve the accuracy and speed of detecting forest fires. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide timely and precise monitoring, which is crucial for preventing widespread forest fire damage and protecting both ecological environments and human lives.
